    "### 10.1 Circular References\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Description\n",
    "* in some languages, such as C# or Java, circular references are easy\n",
    "* but in Rust, they are complicated because of the borrow checker & object lifetime(s) \n",
    "* a circular reference occures when two functions call on each other\n",
    "  * if there is a bad implementation (i.e. no termination condition), then the code could run in a infinite loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "* imagine a class-scheduling programm: where each student can take multiple courses and a course can have multiple students\n",
    "  * a user will want to 1) call a student to see what courses they are enrolled in and 2) call a course to see which students are attending it\n",
    "  * there relationship is n:n\n",
    "  * `struct Student` and `struct Course` will need to have the same lifetime \n",

    "* however, circular referencing and borrowing of lifetimes is not recommended (as native references are static)\n",
    "* using the reference counter `std::rc::Rc` and the reference cell `std:cell::RefCell`, we can implement this\n",
    "* the [RefCell](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/index.html#refcellt) provides \"dynamic borrowing\" \n",
    "* immutable references can be called from `RefCell` with `.borrow()` and mutuable ones with `-borrow_mut()`\n",
    "* but we are losing the static borrow checks during compulation, but only we have some run-time checks"
