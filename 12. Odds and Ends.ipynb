    "* but in certain situations, you may want to use external packages that supply functionality not included by standard Rust\n",
    "* this additional libraries are called `crates` in Rust and are listed on [crates.io](https://crates.io) \n",
    "  * you can search there for what you need and also find documentation on usage\n",
    "  * crates can be downloaded and compiled on your machine\n",
    "  * to import them into your code, use `extern create my_crate` at the top of your script"
