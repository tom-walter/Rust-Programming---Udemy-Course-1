    "### 2.1 Numbers on Computers\n",
    "Representation of Data\n",
    "* in computing, we care about storing and transferring data (information)\n",
    "* there are different types of data we may want to transfer:\n",
    "  * boolean: true, false\n",
    "  * integer and decimal numbers\n",
    "  * text: individual characters, strings of characters\n",
    "  * structure data: HTML, XML, JSON\n",
    "  * binary data: executables, proprietary formats (images)\n",
    "* programming languages work with these specific data types\n",
    "Two Types of Computing\n",
    "* electronic systems fall into 2 types of categories\n",
    "  * analog and digital\n",
    "* analog systems use electric current to represent data\n",
    "  * e.g. 4-20mA current loop\n",
    "* digital systems use pulses to encode data\n",
    "  * communication using a stream of 0s and 1s\n",
    "  * each piece of information (either a 0 or a 1) is called a bit\n",
    "  * we can store bits in memory (RAM, SSD) or transmit them\n",
    "* modern computers are primarily digital \n",
    "  * exceptions are microphones, audio output, etc.\n",
    "  * they have analog-to-digital converters\n",
    "\n",
    "Bits\n",
    "* a single bit is the smallest piece of data in a digital system\n",
    "* it can be either 0 or 1, so it can store anything that has only two options\n",
    "  * gender 0=female, 1=male\n",
    "  * discrete probability 0=not raining, 1=raining\n",
    "* a single bit is not enough to encode a number or piece of text\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Bits\n",
    "* to encode more information with bits, we put them together\n",
    "* 2 bits can encode 4 states like such `00, 01, 10, 11`\n",
    "* generally speaking, $N$ bits allow us to encode $2^N$ states\n",
    "\n",
    "Bytes\n",
    "* the most common value for $N$ is 8, which allows to encode $2^8=256$ states\n",
    "* this is called a byte\n",
    "* example usage:\n",
    "  * human age in a single byte\n",
    "  * Latin-based alphabet + punctuation in a single byte\n",
    "  * but big enough for Chinese or Japanese characters, emojis, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Bytes\n",
    "* if we put 2 bytes together we get $2^{16}=65536$ possible states\n",
    "* a two-byte is called a \"short\" in some programming languages\n",
    "* example usages\n",
    "  * can store larger number\n",
    "  * can store screen coordinates\n",
    "* put 4 bytes together and you have $2^{32}=4*10^{9}$ (4 billion) possible states\n",
    "* put 8 bytes together and you have $2^{64}=1.8*10^{19}$ possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use this?\n",
    "* for storing whole, non-negative numbers (unsigned) numbers\n",
    "  * 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64 bits\n",
    "* for storing whole numbers (signed, possibly negative) \n",
    "  * 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64 bits\n",
    "* examples\n",
    "  * a unsigned 16-bit number [0, 65535]\n",
    "  * a signed 16-bit number [-32768,+32767] (standardized with at center)\n",
    "* for storing non-whole numbers (floating-point numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform-Specific Types\n",
    "* CPUs have processes have bitness\n",
    "  * e.g. \"32-bit CPU\" or \"64-bit CPU\"\n",
    "  * e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio is 32-bit process (even if running on a 64-bit CPU)\n",
    "  * the bitness puts a limit on range of memory (addresses) you can access\n",
    "* many programming languages provide platform-specific integer types (signed and unsigned)\n",
    "  * size of the data depends on the platform you’re targeting\n",
    "  * for example, on a 64-bit machine, a platform-specific integral size would take up 64 bits\n",
    "* these types are useful when you need a general-purpose integer variable (e.g. loop counter) or need to access an array element by index\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-Point Numbers\n",
    "* floating-point numbers are used to store non-whole values: 1.234 or -5.0001\n",
    "* there 2 data types\n",
    "  * 32-bit aka \"float\" or single-precision\n",
    "  * 64-bit aka \"double\" or double-precision \n",
    "* floating-point representation is standardized (IEEE 754)\n",
    "* FP number do not allow exact representation of numbers\n",
    "  * because not all base-10 number can be represented equivalently in base-2\n",
    "  * e.g. that’s why 0.1+0.2 is exactly equal to 0.3 (on computers)\n",
    "* FPs represent a range of special values\n",
    "  * ± infinity, quiet/signaling NaNs"
